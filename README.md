# Lobott.github.io

This is a personal UI/UX design portfolio website created by me to showcase my skills in the field of web design and development. The portfolio includes information about me, my technical expertise, and a collection of design projects I have worked on.

## Projects

The "Projects" section showcases two projects:

1. **CoinCircle**
   - CoinCircle is an imaginary mobile app for money transfers and payments. The design is entirely made on Figma.
3. **swear.ai**
  - swear.ai is an imaginary website that uses AI to elaborate outfits. The design is entirely made on Figma.

Each project shows some design concept applied and they can be read in detail following the link in the footer.

## Feedback

This section is a mock, since I am looking for my first job in Web Development and UI/UX Design. In this section, you'll find a humorous quote from my grandmother, praising my qualities and encouraging you to "take a virtual coffee" with me, which links this section to the hero.

## Contact

You can contact me via email at loris.botto@protonmail.com or explore my resume for more information. The website also offers a downloadable PDF document with project details.

## Technical Details

- The website is built using mostly HTML and CSS, whilst a few lines of JavaScript are used for the "virtual coffee" button.
- It utilises the Bootstrap framework for responsive design.
- Images and styles are stored in separate files for easy maintenance.
- The website includes a responsive navigation menu for different screen sizes.
